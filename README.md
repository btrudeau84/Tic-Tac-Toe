Roadmap of future improvments

1. Add a button to clear the board back to original state. 
2. Keep track of score of individual games AND have multiple games in on large set as an overall winner. example-- have a race to 1o games to declare the winner of the match!
3. make a line go through the x's or o's that are the winning line like we did when we played it on paper.
